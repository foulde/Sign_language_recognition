# Sign_language_recognition
sign language recognition project
This is my first deep learning project.
The goal of this model is to classify sign languages from the [LSA64_PAGE](http://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa64/).


To test this project use the following command 
```bash
python3 final_program.py
```
This model as been trained on the LSA64 Dataset: A Dataset for Argentinian Sign Language
[LSA64_PAGE](http://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa64/)
